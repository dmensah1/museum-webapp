# museum-webapp
 
A full-stack web app built using Angular, Express, Node.js, and MySQL. This app was built to accompany the MySQL database that was created and populated in the 'museum-catalog' repository.

Users can browse different museums, expositions, and artifacts on the app. They also have the ability to add and manage their favorite artifacts and expositions to their profile, as well as purchase admission tickets to the museums in the database.
